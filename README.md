# What is CoinDrip?

CoinDrip is the first token (ESDT) streaming protocol built on MultiversX. Instead of the regular token transfers, you can use CoinDrip to stream tokens each second toward a recipient.

If **you're a non-technical** person interested in using CoinDrip, check out the [faq](faq/ "mention")section.

If **you're a developer** building on MultiversX, check out the [technical-guides](technical-guides/ "mention") and [technical-reference](technical-reference/ "mention")to see how you can take advantage of the CoinDrip protocol in your dApp.&#x20;
